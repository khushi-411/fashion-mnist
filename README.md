<h1 align = 'center'><b> Dimensionality Reduction Techniques and NLP </b> </h1>

I used fashion-mnist dataset to perform `Dimensionality Reduction Techniques and NLP`. It includes: 

* Basic Concept of Dimentionality Reduction
* Feature Selection Techniques
* Dimentionality Reduction Techniques
* Natural Language Processing (NLP) Performed

### **Feature Selection Techniques**

```
* Missing Value Ratio
* Low Variance Filter
* High Correlation filter
* Random Forest
* Backward Feature Elimination
* Forward Feature Selection
```

### **Dimentionality Reduction Techniques**

```
* Singular Value Decomposition
* Principal Component analysis
* Linear Discriminant Analysis
```

### **Natural Language Processing**

```
* Manual Tokenization
* Tokenization and Cleaning with NLTK
* Prepare Text Data with scikit-learn
* The Bag-of-Words Model
```
